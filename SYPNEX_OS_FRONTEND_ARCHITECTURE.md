# Sypnex OS Frontend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Sypnex OS frontend is a modular web-based operating system interface built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It provides a desktop-like experience with window management, app sandboxing, and an API system for user applications.

> **For Contributors**: Understanding this architecture is crucial for frontend contributions. We especially welcome contributions to UI/UX improvements, accessibility enhancements, and cross-browser compatibility.

## App Sandboxing System

### 1. Security Model

**Isolation**:
- Apps run in isolated JavaScript scopes with restricted permissions
- Content is sanitized to prevent some malicious code

**API Injection**:
- SypnexAPI is injected into each app's context with helper functions
- API provides controlled access to system functionality
- Apps receive isolated API instances with app-specific settings
- Window object is extended with SypnexAPI for app access

### 2. Content Sanitization

**Security Measures**:
- HTML content is sanitized before injection
- Dangerous API endpoints are blocked

**Sanitization Process**:
- HTML content is scanned for dangerous API endpoints
- Security warnings replace malicious content


## Development Guidelines

### 1. Code Organization

**File Structure**:
- Core OS files prefixed with `os-`
- API files prefixed with `sypnex-api-`
- CSS files follow component naming
- Templates use descriptive names

**Naming Conventions**:
- Use camelCase for JavaScript functions and variables
- Use kebab-case for CSS classes and HTML IDs
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use descriptive, meaningful names

### 2. Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Provide fallback functionality
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging

**Error Patterns**:
- API failures are handled gracefully with fallback functionality
- User-friendly error messages are displayed
- Errors are logged for debugging purposes
- System stability is maintained during failures

### 3. Testing Considerations

**Unit Testing**:
- Test individual modules in isolation
- Mock API calls for testing
- Test error conditions
- Validate user interactions

**Integration Testing**:
- Test app sandboxing
- Validate API injection
- Test window management
- Verify event handling
